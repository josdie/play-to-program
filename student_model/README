Playing to Program Student Model Files
-------------------------------

This code infers the competence of students in different concepts based on their
performance on problems involving known concepts.  

There are three different executable python files in this code.  They are

      interactive_driver
      data_gen_driver
      test_driver

The interactive_driver lets the user answer questions with known difficulties 
and see how that impacts the student model.  The data_gen_driver generates
a large number of random problems and generative models, and uses them to
test the accuracy of the inference device.  The test_driver reads in a file with
information about an exam and the answers a student gave, and uses these to
make inferences using various models about the student.  Executing any other
file will invoke any unit tests associated with that file. 

If you want to make an improvement - i.e. adding support for multiple problem
solving strategies, reoorganizing code, adding more/better/prettier information
to the file being written, make it in one of the river files.  If you are trying
to test a new thing you are writing or experiment, copy the driver that most 
closely approximates what you are trying to do to a new file (ie 
my_interactive_driver.py and edit that).  If there is some significant added 
functionality, feel free to make a new driver.

All new code should try to follow the Google Python Coding standards located
at

http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html#Python_Style_Rules

Changing old code so it adheres is also not discouraged, but BE SURE to note
any changes other than just adding comments when you check in your code
