</h6>
<p>Welcome to RUR-PLE!&nbsp; In RUR-PLE, you will find a robot named
Reeborg who is controlled by Python programs.&nbsp; These Python
programs contain instructions that tell Reeborg to perform actions and
tests that help Reeborg decide what to do.&nbsp; Reeborg is placed in
an environment that is surrounded by walls and can contain other walls
as well as objects called beepers, which Reeborg can pick up, hold on
to, and put down.&nbsp; To help test and develop your understanding of
Python, you will be given an environment and a Python program, and your
task will be to predict what Reeborg will do when running the given
program.&nbsp; The instructions for Reeborg's actions and tests are
below.<br />
</p>
<h3 class="section">Summary of instructions</h3>

<p>Reeborg's actions:</p>

<pre>move()		- moves Reeborg forward one step<br />turn_left()	- turns Reeborg 90° to the left<br />turn_right()	- turns Reeborg 90° to the right<br />grab_beeper()	- pick up one of the beepers Reeborg is standing on<br />drop_beeper()	- puts down one of the beepers that Reeborg is holding<br />turn_off()	- turns Reeborg off when he has completed a task<br /></pre>

<p>Tests:</p>

<pre>front_is_clear()	- returns True if there is no wall directly in front of Reeborg<br />left_is_clear()		- returns True if there is no wall on Reeborg's left side<br />right_is_clear()	- returns True if there is no wall on Reeborg's right side<br />facing_north()		- returns True if Reeborg is facing upward<br />carries_beepers()	- returns True if Reeborg is holding any beepers<br />on_beeper()		- returns True if Reeborg is standing on any beepers<br /></pre>

<h3 class="section">Entering Your Prediction<br />
</h3>
<p>To get started, click on the Robot: Code and Learn tab above, and then click on the Submit/Next button on the toolbar.&nbsp; <img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="Submit/Next" title="Submit/Next" src="../../rur_images/goto.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>An environment and program will be loaded.&nbsp; Your task is to
predict the sequence of actions that Reeborg will perform by running
the given program, and input this prediciton using the keyboard and
mouse.&nbsp; If you click outside of the robot area while your entering
your prediction, you may need to click the robot area to regain control
of the robot.<br />
</p>
<p>The controls for Reeborg's actions are:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move - up arrow key on the keyboard</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Turn Left - left arrow key on the keyboard</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Turn Right - right arrow key on the keyboard</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Grab Beeper - 'g' key on the keyboard or the Grab beeper button on the toolbar&nbsp;  <img style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="Grab Beeper" title="Grab Beeper" src="../../rur_images/beepers_minus.png" /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Drop Beeper - 'd' key on the keyboard or the Drop beeper button on the toolbar&nbsp; <img style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="Drop Beeper" title="Drop Beeper" src="../../rur_images/beepers_plus.png" /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Print text to console (Python print statement) - 'p' key on the keyboard or the Print text to console button on the toolbar  <img style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="Print text to console" title="Print text to console" src="../../rur_images/pencil.png" /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Undo a previously entered action - 'u' key on the keyboard or the Undo robot action button on the toolbar  <img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="Undo robot action" title="Undo robot action" src="../../rur_images/show_hide.png" /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Reset and start the prediction over from the beginning - Reset world button on the toolbar&nbsp; <img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="Reset world" title="Reset world" src="../../rur_images/reset_world.png" /><br />
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Turn Off - 'o' key on the keyboard or the Turn robot off button on the toolbar &nbsp;  <img style="width: 22px; height: 30px;" alt="Turn robot off" title="Turn robot off" src="../../rur_images/robot_off.png" /></li>
</ul>
<span class="warning" />
<p class="warning important"><span class="important"><span class="warning important">*** Don't forget to turn Reeborg off at the end of your prediction!!!</span></span><span class="important" /> ***<br />
</p>
<h3><span class="section">Errors</span><br />
</h3>
<p>Certain actions can cause errors which make Reeborg complain and
turn off.&nbsp; If you believe an action in the program will cause an
error, do not enter any more actions after the one that causes the
error.&nbsp; If you input an action that causes an error and you did
not mean to, make sure you Undo that action (you will see that action
disappear from the console window on the bottom right).<br />
</p>
<p>Actions which cause errors:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move - when a wall is in front of Reeborg</li>
  <li>Grab Beeper - when Reeborg is not standing on any beepers</li>
  <li>Drop Beeper - when Reeborg is not holding any beepers<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="section">Checking your answer</span><br />
</h3>
<p>Once you have entered your prediction, click on the Submit/Next button on the toolbar.&nbsp; <img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="Submit/Next" title="Submit/Next" src="../../rur_images/goto.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>RUR-PLE will then run the robot program, and you can watch and see
what it really does.&nbsp; You can control the speed with which the
program runs by using the Adjust robot speed slider on the
toolbar&nbsp; <img style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="Adjust robot speed" title="Adjust robot speed" src="../../rur_images/speed.png" />.&nbsp; As the program runs, the line of code
that is currently executing will be highlighted in the code window on
the left.&nbsp; When the program is done running, RUR-PLE will pop up a
dialog telling you whether or not your prediction was correct.<br />
</p>
<p>Once the program has run, if there were errors in your prediction,
you can run the program again and see where your prediction and the
actions that were actually taken by the robot differ.&nbsp; The
controls for this are on the toolbar and behave like a visual debugger,
which will be familiar if you have ever used one.&nbsp; These controls
are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="Run robot program" title="Run robot program" src="../../rur_images/run1.png" />- Run the program</li>
  <li><img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="Step through robot program instructions" title="Step through robot program instructions" src="../../rur_images/step.png" />- Execute one statement and move to the next statement</li>
  <li><img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="Pause program" title="Pause program" src="../../rur_images/pause.png" />- Pause/Unpause execution of the program</li>
  <li><img style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="Stop program" title="Stop program" src="../../rur_images/stop.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Stop running the program</li>
</ul>
<p>As the program executes, the line of code that is currently
executing will again be highlighted in the code window on the
left.&nbsp; As the robot actions execute, the robot executing your
predicted actions will be blue&nbsp; <img style="width: 22px; height: 30px;" alt="Your prediction robot" title="Your prediction robot" src="../../rur_images/blue_robot_e.png" />
and trace a blue line through the environment.&nbsp; The robot
executing with correct actions will be the normal gray color&nbsp; <img style="width: 22px; height: 30px;" alt="Correct robot" title="Correct robot" src="../../rur_images/robot_e.png" /> and trace a green line through the environment.&nbsp; Also,
the next robot action that will execute will be highlighted in the
console window on the bottom right.&nbsp; These actions will be
preceded by a word which indicates which robot will execute them, and
those words are:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CORRECT:&nbsp; Your prediction of this action was correct and both robots will perform the action</li>
  <li>INCORRECT:&nbsp; Your prediction of this action was incorrect, and only your robot will perform it</li>
  <li>CORRECTED:&nbsp; You did not predict this action, and the robot performing the correct actions will</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="comment">Note:&nbsp;  Incorrect actions involving beepers (grab and drop) will not be reflected in the environment.</span></p>
<p class="suggested">Note:&nbsp; If the program is paused, make sure you run it to completion or stop it before proceeding to the next problem.<br />
</p>
<p>When you are satisifed that you understand the differences between
your prediction and the correct actions of the robot, you may proceed
to the next problem by clicking on the Submit/Next button on the
toolbar.&nbsp; <img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="Submit/Next" title="Submit/Next" src="../../rur_images/goto.png" /></p>
